## Project Setup

To successfully set up and run the project, follow these steps for both the frontend and backend.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Run the following commands to install necessary packages:
   ```bash
   npm install axios
   npm install react-router-dom
   npm install leaflet react-leaflet
   ```
2. **Start the Application**  
   Run the frontend using:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Backend Setup

1. **User Authentication Module**  
   Start the User Authentication module. This will automatically use port `8080`.

2. **SOS Module Setup**  
   - Update the `application.properties` file in the SOS module with your email configuration for SMTP and MySQL database connection. Hereâ€™s a sample configuration:

     ```properties
     # SMTP Configuration for Email
     spring.mail.host=smtp.gmail.com
     spring.mail.port=587
     spring.mail.username=your_user_email
     spring.mail.password=your_email_password
     spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.auth=true
     spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.starttls.enable=true
     spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.ssl.trust=smtp.gmail.com

     # SOS Module Server Port
     server.port=8081

     # Database Configuration
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/users
     spring.datasource.username=root
     spring.datasource.password=Jitesh@2001
     spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
     spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
     spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect = org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect
     spring.jpa.show-sql=true
     ```
   - **Run the SOS Module**  
     After configuring, run the SOS module. Note that it might take a moment to load fully.
